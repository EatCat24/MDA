In this section, we aim to predict the likelihood of dying from cardiac events by using machine learning techniques. 

To achieve this goal, We conduct a comprehensive comparative analysis of three predictive models: Random Forest, XGBoost, and CatBoost. We choose abandon reason as our target, indicating whether the patients die of cardiac events. We choose waiting time, event level trip and vector type as our features because they are critical in medical scenarios . 

By evaluating and comparing the performance of these models using multiple metrics, we could choose the optimal model to predict outcomes.
